> What's the difference between compiled and interpreted language?

Compiled program can work only on the platform for which it was designed (e.g. ".exe" for Windows). We can't run it on the other OS.
(noone can look throught or edit our code in this kind of program).

Interpreted program can be open only if we have "interpreter" installed on our client. It's kind of program which are not previously compiled into machine-language instructions.


> What are the different types of web hosting exist?

1. Shared Web Hosting. The website is hosted on a server shared by other websites. The advantage of this setup is the shared cost. You can pay as little as $5 to $10 per month for sharing a super server with (probably) hundreds (or thousands) of other websites.  

2. Reseller Web Hosting. Reseller hosting packages are basically a shared hosting account with extra tools to help you resell hosting space.

3. Cloud Based Web Hosting. The idea is that as the need grows, the hosting company can just add more commodity hardware to make an ever larger grid or cloud. The advantage of cloud-based web hosting is that if you get an unusually large amount of website traffic the web hosting plan can accommodate the surge of traffic - rather than shutting the website down.  

4. Virtual Private Server (VPS). Virtual private servers share one physical server but act like multiple, separate servers. A VPS is a stepping stone between shared hosting and getting your own dedicated machine. Even though each VPS instance shares hardware resources, they are allocated a dedicated slice of the computing resources.

5. Dedicated Web Server. When you have a dedicated server, it means you are renting one physical server from a hosting company. You can have full control (called "root" permissions in Linux) if you want it. A dedicated server is generally the highest level of server you would need if your online business grows into a presence that is getting a lot of website traffic. While the costs of a dedicated server are significantly higher than shared hosting, your business will be at a point that can easily afford the necessary costs of having your own server.

6. Colocation Web Hosting. When you colocate, you rent rack space from a data center. You bring in your own server hardware and they provide power, cooling, physical security, and an internet uplink. This means you're responsible for your own server software, data storage, backup procedures, etc. If hardware fails, you're responsible for replacing it and getting the server back up and running.

7. Self Service Web Hosting. You buy the servers, install and configure the software, make sure there are sufficient cooling and power in your machine room, and double up everything for redundancy. 

8. Managed WordPress Hosting. Managed WordPress hosting is a service where the web hosting provider will keep your WordPress installation up-to-date which can help protect your site from security threats that would allow hackers into your website.
